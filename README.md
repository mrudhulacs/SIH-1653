SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software.
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea


1.AI-Powered Interview Simulation : The system uses AI and NLP to generate dynamic questions based on the applicant’s expertise and job profile.It ensures a structured interview flow, starting with ice-breaking 
   questions and gradually transitioning into in-depth technical and managerial queries.

   
2.Intelligent Scoring & Evaluation : AI assigns a relevancy score to each question based on how well it aligns with the candidate's expertise.Candidate responses are evaluated and scored based on correctness, 
   depth, and relevance.The system aggregates all scores to determine the candidate’s overall suitability for the position.
   
3.Expert-Assisted Interview Process : The platform provides real-time feedback to interviewers, helping them refine question quality and relevance.Multiple experts can collaborate to assess and validate candidate 
   responses, ensuring a fair evaluation process.
   
4.Interactive Boardroom Experience : Video and audio analysis help assess a candidate’s confidence, communication skills, and engagement level.A virtual interview environment is created to provide a realistic and 
   professional experience for both interviewers and candidates.
   
5.Data Analytics & Reporting : The system tracks interview performance over time, providing insights into candidate strengths and weaknesses.Customizable reports help decision-makers evaluate candidates more 
   effectively.Bias detection mechanisms analyze scoring patterns to ensure fairness in assessments.
   
6.Security & Compliance : Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can access specific data.All candidate responses and scores are encrypted to maintain confidentiality.The platform complies 
   with GDPR and government recruitment policies to ensure data security and ethical hiring practices.
